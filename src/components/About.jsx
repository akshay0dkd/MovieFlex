        Hi! I'm Akshay Bhiogade, a
        passionate and curious B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student
        at GH Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur. I love building things
        that live on the internet â€” especially using React.js, JavaScript,
        and modern web tools like Vite and Tailwind CSS.

        I'm currently sharpening my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms
        using C++, while also exploring full-stack development with plans to
        master Java for backend and Android projects.

        Beyond academics, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive projects,
        debugging weird errors (yes, even 404s ðŸ˜…), and constantly learning
        how to write cleaner, scalable code. I'm also familiar with
        Git/GitHub workflows and love collaborating through open-source or
        team projects.

        Whether it's a web app, a coding challenge, or a new framework â€” I'm
        always up for the next challenge.

        Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together!
